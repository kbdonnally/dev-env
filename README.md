# Hacky Dev Env:

## So you [deleted/broke/lost/don't have access to] your computer.

But you do have a different computer! It just... doesn't have any of your stuff on it. Let's try to make restoring a workable development environment as quick/painless as possible. *NB: These instructions are for Windows 10, should some poor soul besides myself happen upon this repo.*

As much of the stuff you need is included here as possible; if not, there'll hopefully be specific instructions and links. (Also, if the stuff is like, hella out of date you should re-download it. This is all from January 2018.)
